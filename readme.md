# INIT

The `R` package `INIT` (Individual Network Invariance Test) provides an easy way to test for (in)equality between idiographic network structures. INIT extends standard model comparison techniques from Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to network psychometrics and can be used to test if the same network structure applies across different individuals or if the same network structure holds for one individual over time. By inspecting model selection criteria such as the AIC and BIC, INIT provides an easy way to compare idiographic network structures.

# Installation 

You can install the current developmental version in R using the remotes-package:
